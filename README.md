## Welcome!  ðŸ‘‹

If you're here to take a look at the way I code, here are some samples for you.

- [Ether Pay](https://github.com/shawnbusuttil/ether-pay) - A simple interface for sending ETH on testnet and seeing your transaction history.
- [Asset Portfolio](https://github.com/shawnbusuttil/asset-portfolio) - A portfolio of assets, including the ability to filter by distribution.
- [Bit Pay](https://github.com/shawnbusuttil/bitpay) - A simple interface for generating a random BTC address QR code on testnet that polls for payment. 

I'm looking to help with "_fixing the money, fixing the world_". ðŸ˜‰
